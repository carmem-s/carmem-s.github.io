            3D dress form inspired by the work of Charles James with the intent to start a critical reflection on how we can reclaim acknowledgement our tacit practice in these new digital interfaces.

            The Sound of Knitting

          <br>
          <p>
            The sound of a working Brother KH 910 was recorded for several knitting jobs. The recorded sounds were used to generate a glitch image which then was knitted using the same (hacked) machine.

            The Soft Omn is an embroidered multimeter build using an ATtiny microcontroller, a Flora NeoPixel, a speaker, a LED and conductive thread. This tool can measure resistance and translate it into light and sound.

            Thinking drawing as a way of understandinf the body as media relating with it's environment. Drawing is not accepting images as representation of reality but as a phenomenon resulting from a comprehension and a relation between body and world. 
            The collection thinks clothes and the process of fashion creation and development as a reverse drawing being the process from 2D to 3D, thinking lines as result of negociation between clothes, body and previous understandments of those. All the pieces are gestural, they were thought, created, patterned and developed as drawings and drawn over. The deformation created by this process, accentuates the movement of the body and prints.

            The Hyper Textile
          </p> 
          <br>
          <p>
            The Hyper Textile is an interactive instalation that captured touch and amplified the vibrations in real time, amplifying the original sound of each textile. As a result, we get an augmented exploratory experience through the relationship that both amplifies the senses and blurs the boundaries between the physical material and its digitally augmented properties, both the design practice and for the viewer.
